A palindromic number or numeral palindrome is a number that remains the same when
its digits are reversed. Like 16461, for example, it is "symmetrical".
The term palindromic is derived from palindrome, which refers to a word
(such as rotor or racecar) whose spelling is unchanged when its letters are reversed.
The first 30 palindromic numbers (in decimal) are:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99,
101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202

Please write a program which takes a positive number N from the user, and outputs
all the **palindromic prime** numbers smaller than N.

Example:

```shell
Please input number N: 120
2
3
5
7
11
101

```

Hint: you can write two functions, one to test if a number is palindromic, another one
to test if a number is a prime number.
