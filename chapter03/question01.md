In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence,
called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after
the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

![Definition of Fibonacci sequence](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/6/f/76f99713cf111eb035d908228c351710.png)

Please write a function fibonacci(n) that returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
In python, it is possible that a function calls itself. This is called recursive.

Then plesae finish the main program by taking an interger N from the user and output the
value of fibonacci(N). The user input will be guaranteed to be valid and smaller than 1000.


Example 1

```shell
Input: 2
Output: 1
```

Example 2

```shell
Input: 10
Output: 55
```
